Creating a character sheet in a webpage

# Getting started on Windows
First install ruby (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and the development
kit (https://github.com/OneClick/RubyInstaller/wiki/Development-Kit). Once
those are correctly configured, run `gem install bundler`. Finally, from the
project directory, run `bundle install`.

Once everything is set up, run `ruby server.rb` to start the server. Navigate
to `localhost:4567` to see the test page and verify that everything is working
correctly.
